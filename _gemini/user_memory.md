# User Memory - Jamie

## Preferences & Coding Style
- **Philosophy:** "The Logging Loop is God" - every decision prioritizes speed and frictionless set logging.
- **Privacy:** Offline-first, all data stays local (Room DB).
- **Units:** Prefers Imperial (lbs, miles) for the UI, but understands the value of Meters/Seconds for DB standardization.
- **UI Aesthetic:** Likes clean, high-performance interfaces (e.g., segmented HH:MM:SS inputs, large icons).
- **Branching:** ALWAYS requires a branch for code changes and Git operations.
- **Approval:** ALWAYS requires explicit plan approval before execution.

## Personal Information
- **Name:** Jamie
- **Wife:** Tori (Travel Nurse)
- **Lifestyle:** They live wherever Tori's assignment is for 3 months, then spend a month at their lake house in Michigan. Travel is #1 priority.
- **History:** Highly passionate about Adobe After Effects, video editing, and CGI as a kid. This interest is re-emerging.
- **Pets:** Cat's name is Whiskers.
- **Food:** Likes pineapple on pizza.

## System Usage & Communication Log
- **Session 2025-12-18:** Implemented "Sustainable Streaks" and Cardio Overhaul. Jamie preferred a "Segmented Tape" input for time entry over "ATM-style" after testing.
- **Session 2025-12-18 (Evening):** Overhauled Volume Orb visual engagement. Jamie initially suggested a "Glass Jar" effect using a PNG but decided on a 100% procedural Canvas implementation after alignment issues. 
- **Creative Flair:** Jamie's After Effects/CGI background influenced the "procedural glass" look (radial gradients, rim lights, particle bubbles).
- **UI Feedback:** Jamie preferred larger icons for streaks and blue "glow" circles for skip indicators.
- **Naming:** Renamed "Sustainable Consistency" to "Iron Streak Overview" to be less "hippie".
- **Theming:** Orb and Progress Bar were made fully theme-aware to match Jamie's custom AppColorScheme (Lime, Blue, etc.).
