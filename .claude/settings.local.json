This prevents the jarring experience of going directly to exercise selection when accidentally navigating back.\n\nChanges:\n- Created WorkoutResumeScreen with ViewModel to display today''s exercises\n- Shows exercise name, muscle group, set count, and best weight\n- Tap exercise card → navigate to logging screen for that exercise\n- FAB button → navigate to exercise selection to add new exercise\n- Empty state card with clear CTA when no exercises logged yet\n- Updated home navigation: ongoing workout → WorkoutResume, new workout → ExerciseSelection\n- Added WorkoutResume route to navigation graph\n- Updated BottomNavigationBar to handle new screen in exhaustive when\n\nUX improvements:\n- Better workout continuity when resuming sessions\n- Quick access to already-logged exercises\n- Clear visual feedback of session progress\n- Maintains \"Logging Loop is God\" philosophy with minimal friction\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")",
